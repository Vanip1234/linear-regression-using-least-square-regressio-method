# linear-regression-using-least-square-regression-method


To apply linear regression using least square regressio method and build a model that studies the relationship between the head size and brain weight of an individual.
The model will be evaluated by using least square regression method where RMSE and R-squared will be the model evaluation parameters.
Dataset Description:
Gender: Male or female represented as binary variables
Age: Age of an individual
Head size in cm^3: An individuals head size in cm^3
Brain weight in grams: The weight of an individualâ€™s brain measured in grams

Model is doing good and can be used for further predictions
